# Introduction

NuxtShop is a highly-customizable, open-source starter kit, introduced at [Vue.js Nation 2022](https://vimeo.com/671090407), for building headless Shopify stores with Nuxt 3. It comes out of the box
with a great developer experience and in-built performance practices as a foundation for a production-quality eCommerce site.

## Shopify Setup

- Create a Shopify store
  - Tip: Sign up as a [Shopify Partner](https://www.shopify.com/partners) to get access to development stores.
- In your new store, go to Apps, [create a private app](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/apps/private-apps) and give it Storefront API access
- Recommended reading: [Getting started with the Shopify Storefront API](https://shopify.dev/api/storefront/getting-started)
- This project references a collection named 'All', but you can adjust that to whatever you like.
- Optional: [Sample Shopify product CSVs](https://github.com/shopifypartners/product-csvs). The demo uses 'apparel.csv'.

## App Setup

- rename .env.sample to .env
- Add your Shopify Access Token and \*.myshopify url to the .env variables

## Limitations

Because NuxtShop is built in the open and on the bleeding-edge, there are a few limitations to be aware of:

1. NuxtShop is built on Nuxt3 which at this time is still officially in beta
2. NuxtShop uses the new Shopify Cart API which does not support Shopify Scripts on Plus yet. To use scripts, you can adjust to the Checkout API

---

## Troubleshoot

Deploying to Layer0? [Node 14](https://forum.layer0.co/t/layer0-doesnt-work-with-node-16/577) is the latest supported version.
